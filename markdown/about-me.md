# About Me

## Biography

I'm trying to find a balance between research and engineering.

My current research interests primarily focus on understanding and enhancing the continuity, generalizability, efficiency, and other key properties of machine learning. I am also interested in large multimodal models.

I'm also learning web development and building machine learning software and systems.
